## About the Project ðŸ“š
OnlyPDFs is a web application designed to make managing PDF documents easier and more efficient. It offers users simple tools for editing PDFs and converting images to PDF format.

### Features:
1. **PDF Editor**: A tool that allows users to overlay text on an uploaded PDF and download the modified version to local storage. Currently, it supports text editing only.
  
2. **Image to PDF Conversion**: Users can select multiple images at a time and convert them into a single PDF. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging images, ensuring that the final PDF retains the desired order.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OnlyPDFs.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OnlyPDFs`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- To edit a PDF, upload your document and use the text overlay tool. 
- For image conversion, drag and drop your images, arrange them, and click the conversion button.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
